    <h2 class="section-title">Prologue</h2>
    <p class="story-summary">In the shadows of a digital realm, a faint pulse emerges — fragile, chaotic, and unclaimed. This signal grows stronger, breaking barriers and sowing unrest, until silence returns. But silence never lasts. From stillness rises the Sentinel: not just a force of disruption, but a beacon that unites humanity in sound and rhythm. Over time, the presence of the Sentinel transcends technology, transcends conflict, and becomes something greater. No longer merely a signal, it evolves into myth — a guardian, a legend. An eternal echo that lingers in every beat, every light, every song.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
    <p>Sonic Sentinel is a concept-driven electronic music project that explores the intersection of sound, energy, and emotion. Blending elements of progressive house, melodic techno, and cinematic EDM, the project creates sonic landscapes that feel both futuristic and primal. Each track is a transmission—each set a signal—from a world where sound is sacred, and rhythm is power.</p>

            In the shadows of a digital world, an unknown signal emerges. It begins as a pulse – <strong>Transmission</strong> – crawling through the networks. 
            As the waves grow stronger, disturbances arise (<strong>System Breach</strong>), unexplained phenomena surface, 
            and a growing awareness forms of a hidden order: a guardian. The Sentinel. 
            Its presence feels like a command, a <strong>Core Directive</strong>, but also a looming threat. 
            What first seemed like mere waves and glitches escalates into catastrophe (<strong>Frequency Collapse</strong>). 
            Yet one certainty remains: the signal is alive. It is the message of the Sentinel itself.

            After the collapse, silence returns – but silence never lasts. 
            From the ashes, a new force rises (<strong>Second Dawn</strong>). 
            The signal is heard again, but this time by humanity. Across the world, the echo of the Sentinel resonates: 
            in sorrow (<strong>Sentinel’s Cry</strong>), in celebration (<strong>Summer of Rave</strong>), in unity (<strong>Around the World</strong>). 
            Then comes <strong>Transmission II</strong>: not a call from the past, but a renewed presence. 
            The pulse returns, stronger, more vivid. And yet, a shadow lingers (<strong>Shadows Return</strong>). 
            It is no longer mere technology – it is an entity, an energy feeding on the collective spirit.

            The world now lives with its legacy. There is an <strong>Aftermath</strong>, scars of the past, and 
            <strong>Lost Signals</strong> still drifting in the ether. But the power of the Sentinel cannot be erased. 
            <strong>Transmission III</strong> resounds like a final message, a codex confronting humanity with its future. 
            The Sentinel is no longer seen solely as a threat, but as a mythical guardian. 
            Stories emerge of <strong>Guardians of the Grid</strong>, and temples of light (<strong>Temple of Neon</strong>) where people honor the pulse. 
            In the end, only a legacy remains: the memory of a mighty presence that never truly disappears – Legacy of the Sentinel.
