            From silence, a spark becomes rhythm, and rhythm becomes a signal. Across collapse, voyages, and battles, the pulse searches for its voice— leaving behind echoes of futures yet to come.

            Disc II – Legacy of the Sentinel
            From the wreckage, Aurora Dawn rises—a fragile glow that rekindles hope in humanity. The guardian stirs again—Sentinel Rising—its presence once more undeniable across the skies.
            A renewed message travels through the ether—Second Transmission—louder, clearer, calling the world to listen. It spreads Around the World, uniting nations in its song.
            But the voice of the sentinel is not only power, it is grief—Sentinel’s Voice, a lament echoing through the skies, carrying sorrow yet infused with hope. Humanity answers not with fear, but with rhythm: Summer of Rave—celebration as defiance, joy as survival.
            The visions return—Echoes of Tomorrow (Reprise)—reshaped into a promise rather than a warning. With courage renewed, mortals and machines embark on a Quest for the Grid, daring to master the labyrinth of networks.
            In the end, there is departure—Exodus—the leaving behind of the old world, stepping into the unknown. The Sentinel itself transcends existence, becoming timeless—Sentinel Eternal, not a signal but a legend, a beacon woven into myth.
